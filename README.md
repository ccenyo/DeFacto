A Fact-Validation framework :x: :white_check_mark:

DeFacto is a framework for validating statements by finding confirming sources for it. It takes a statement (such as “<i>Jamaica Inn was directed by Alfred Hitchcock</i>”) as input and then tries to find evidence for the truth of that statement by searching for information in the web ([more information](http://sda.cs.uni-bonn.de/projects/defacto/)).
